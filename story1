The Ram was large. He was much too heavy for the Crow to carry. 
T
he Crow tried again and again, but without success.

The Ram felt the Crow on its back and was most annoyed. Just what do you think you are doing, you pesky bird?' 
he snapped, glaring at him over his shoulder.

The Crow flapped harder still, trying to carry the Ram away.

‘Now stop that!' cried the Ram. ‘Go away! Shoo! Leave me in peace!’ He jumped and bucked and tried to shake the Crow off his back.

But crow was not ready for going anywhere, he wandered high in sky looking after ram and ram was searching for thing with great value and he was so deep into it he almost forgot where he is and whats lays behind the darkness of jungle but crows knows it better and thats why he was looking for ram, but what was he unware of that there was another creature lurking around but this time not on the ground but rather it was with crow in sky but higher much higher than crow, he was following his prey, far from sky with one single goal and that was that crow but he was unware and then he saw that there is one wild dog was behind ram and he was going to attacked but eagle attacked the crow and somehow crow dodge that and he was still not thinking about getting killed he was thinking about how to save ram and then idea hit that he could draw the eagle to that wild dog so when he came in front of that wild dog wild dog will gonna attack the crow but he jumps with a delay and caches the eagle and and crow taking advantage of this isituation he took ram and flew away.
